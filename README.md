# GitHomework-04-CodeQuiz
Deployed website: https://tingtingctt.github.io/Code-Quiz/.

The quiz uses "container-fluid" to adapt to any screen sizes.

The "scores" page has its separate html with its own scores.js.

In script.js, I separanted the codes into different genres (global variables, followed by functions, followed by event listeners). To display the 5 quiz questions, I used a large portion of space to repeat the same functions (which I realized there is a shorter way to do so using arrays, but I'm out of time to streamline it...) To compensate, I created a quizArray[i] to call consecutive quizzes and the result page.

However, I have tested the pages, which should all work ok. And the local storage works fine, too.
